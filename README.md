**Basic serial number generator**
This generator was made to produce a number of unique serial numbers that can ultimately be tied to barcodes. At the moment, the serial numbers are placed into a comma separated list then placed into a textarea. If the functionality to wrap the numbers in quotation marks is required, I supposed I could add it, but at the moment, this can be accomplished using your favorite text editor.

**Install**
* Clone the git repo
* Run npm install
* Run npm start
* Navigate to localhost:3000
* Fill out form, hit go
